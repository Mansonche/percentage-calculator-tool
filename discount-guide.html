        <article class="article-content">
            <p>We've all been there: you're walking through a store and see a sign that says "30% Off Everything!" or "Buy One, Get the Second at 50% Off." While these deals sound great, it's not always immediately clear how much you'll actually be paying at the register. Understanding how to calculate discounts is a vital life skill that can help you stick to your budget and identify truly great deals.</p>

            <h2>The Basic Discount Formula</h2>
            <p>Calculating a discount is a two-step process. First, you find the amount of the discount, and then you subtract that amount from the original price.</p>
            
            <div class="formula-box">
                <p><strong>Discount Amount = Original Price × (Discount Percentage / 100)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Sale Price = Original Price - Discount Amount</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Method 1: The Direct Calculation</h2>
            <p>If you have a calculator (like the one on our homepage), this is the most straightforward method. Let's say you find a jacket that costs <strong>$85.00</strong> and it's <strong>25% off</strong>.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Convert the percentage to a decimal: 25% = 0.25</li>
                <li>Multiply the price by the decimal: $85.00 × 0.25 = $21.25 (This is your discount)</li>
                <li>Subtract the discount from the original price: $85.00 - $21.25 = <strong>$63.75</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Method 2: The "Remaining Percentage" Shortcut</h2>
            <p>This is often faster because it combines the steps. If an item is 25% off, that means you are paying <strong>75%</strong> of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> For the same $85.00 jacket:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Subtract the discount from 100%: 100% - 25% = 75%</li>
                <li>Convert to decimal: 0.75</li>
                <li>Multiply the original price by this decimal: $85.00 × 0.75 = <strong>$63.75</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This method gives you the final price in just one multiplication step!</p>

            <h2>Mental Math Tips for Shoppers</h2>
            <p>When you're in the aisle and don't want to pull out your phone, use these "benchmark" percentages to estimate:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10% Off:</strong> Just move the decimal point one place to the left. ($50 becomes $5)</li>
                <li><strong>20% Off:</strong> Find 10% and double it. ($50 → $5 → $10)</li>
                <li><strong>50% Off:</strong> Simply cut the price in half. ($50 becomes $25)</li>
                <li><strong>25% Off:</strong> Cut the price in half, then half again. ($80 → $40 → $20)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Shopping Traps to Avoid</h2>
            <p>Retailers often use complex-sounding deals to make you spend more. Here are a few to watch out for:</p>
            
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>The Deal</th>
                        <th>The Reality</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>"Up to 70% Off"</strong></td>
                        <td>Most items are likely only 10-20% off. Only a few clearance items hit the 70% mark.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>"Buy 2, Get 1 Free"</strong></td>
                        <td>This is equivalent to a 33.3% discount on each item, but only if you actually need three of them.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>"Double Discounts"</strong></td>
                        <td>If an item is 20% off and you have a 10% coupon, it's NOT 30% off. It's 10% off the already discounted price (Total discount = 28%).</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
