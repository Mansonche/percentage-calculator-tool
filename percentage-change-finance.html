        <article class="article-content">
            <p>Percentage change is arguably the most important calculation in finance and economics. It is the standard metric used to track the performance of investments, measure inflation, analyze sales growth, and understand price fluctuations. Unlike a simple difference, percentage change provides a <strong>relative</strong> measure of change, allowing for meaningful comparisons between two values regardless of their scale.</p>

            <h2>The Formula for Percentage Change</h2>
            <p>The calculation for percentage change is designed to measure the magnitude of the change relative to the original value. The formula is as follows:</p>
            
            <div class="formula-box">
                <p><strong>Percentage Change = (New Value - Original Value) / Original Value × 100</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>The result will be a positive number for a percentage <strong>increase</strong> and a negative number for a percentage <strong>decrease</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Case Study 1: Tracking Stock Market Performance</h2>
            <p>Imagine you purchased a stock for <strong>$50.00</strong> per share (Original Value). Six months later, the stock is trading at <strong>$65.00</strong> per share (New Value).</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Find the Difference (Change):</strong> $65.00 - $50.00 = $15.00</li>
                <li><strong>Divide by the Original Value:</strong> $15.00 ÷ $50.00 = 0.30</li>
                <li><strong>Convert to Percentage:</strong> 0.30 × 100 = 30%</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The stock experienced a <strong>30% increase</strong>. This is a much more informative metric than simply saying the stock went up by $15. A 30% return is considered excellent in the investment world, and this percentage allows you to compare this stock's performance to other investments.</p>

            <h2>Case Study 2: Analyzing Sales Decline</h2>
            <p>A small business recorded <strong>$12,000</strong> in sales last month (Original Value). This month, sales dropped to <strong>$10,800</strong> (New Value).</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Find the Difference (Change):</strong> $10,800 - $12,000 = -$1,200</li>
                <li><strong>Divide by the Original Value:</strong> -$1,200 ÷ $12,000 = -0.10</li>
                <li><strong>Convert to Percentage:</strong> -0.10 × 100 = -10%</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The business experienced a <strong>10% decrease</strong> in sales. The negative sign is crucial as it indicates a loss or decline. Understanding this percentage helps the business owner see that the decline is significant and warrants investigation into the cause.</p>

            <h2>Why Percentage Change Matters More Than Dollar Amount</h2>
            <p>Consider two scenarios:</p>
            
            <table class="comparison-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Scenario</th>
                        <th>Original Value</th>
                        <th>Change</th>
                        <th>Dollar Increase</th>
                        <th>Percentage Increase</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Stock A</strong></td>
                        <td>$10</td>
                        <td>→ $15</td>
                        <td>+$5</td>
                        <td>+50%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Stock B</strong></td>
                        <td>$100</td>
                        <td>→ $110</td>
                        <td>+$10</td>
                        <td>+10%</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Stock B had a larger dollar increase ($10 vs. $5), but Stock A had a much better percentage return (50% vs. 10%). If you were an investor, Stock A would be the better investment because it grew at a faster rate. This is why percentage change is the standard metric in finance.</p>

            <h2>The Difference Between Percentage Change and Percentage Difference</h2>
            <p>It is important not to confuse percentage change with percentage difference.</p>
            
            <table class="comparison-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Calculation</th>
                        <th>Formula</th>
                        <th>Use Case</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Percentage Change</strong></td>
                        <td>(New - Original) / Original × 100</td>
                        <td>Measures change over time (e.g., stock growth, inflation). <strong>Requires a clear starting point.</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Percentage Difference</strong></td>
                        <td>|Value 1 - Value 2| / (Value 1 + Value 2)/2 × 100</td>
                        <td>Measures the difference between two values relative to their average. <strong>Used when there is no clear starting point.</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>For example, if you are comparing the price of two competing products, you would use percentage difference. If you are comparing the price of a product this year versus last year, you would use percentage change.</p>

            <h2>Real-World Application: Tracking Your Savings</h2>
            <p>Let's say you started the year with <strong>$5,000</strong> in savings. By the end of the year, you have saved <strong>$6,250</strong>. What is your percentage increase?</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Find the difference: $6,250 - $5,000 = $1,250</li>
                <li>Divide by the original value: $1,250 ÷ $5,000 = 0.25</li>
                <li>Convert to percentage: 0.25 × 100 = 25%</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Your savings increased by <strong>25%</strong>. This is a significant achievement and shows that your savings strategy is working. By tracking this percentage year over year, you can set realistic goals and measure your financial progress.</p>
