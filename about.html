            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The Simple Percentage Calculator was created with one goal in mind: to provide the fastest, most accurate, and easiest-to-use percentage calculation tool on the web. We understand that while percentages are simple in theory, manual calculations can be tedious and error-prone.</p>
            
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>We are a small team of developers and students dedicated to building useful digital utilities that solve everyday problems. We believe that the best tools are the ones that do one thing perfectly, without unnecessary clutter or complexity.</p>

            <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
            <p>Whether you're a student, a business professional, or just someone trying to figure out a discount while shopping, we wanted to create a resource that you can rely on. Our tool is free to use and will always remain so, supported by minimal and non-intrusive advertising.</p>
